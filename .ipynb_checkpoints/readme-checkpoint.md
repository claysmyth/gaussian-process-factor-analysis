This repository is a class project for Stat 238 - Bayesian Statistics, in which we implement a version of [Gaussian Process Factor Analysis](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/software.shtml). We made use of some utility function from [Elephant](https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/gpfa.html)

### Structure of the repo
The repo can be walked through in 4 notebooks:
0. readme: this notebook. It details the derivations and explains numerical implementation variants.
1. makeData. It generates simulated data for testing.
2. vanillaGPFA. It runs our implementation.
3. appendix. It compares various implementations of the matrix inversion of the form used in this package.
